Known Issues
I can't seem to get the shortest path to goal orientation right.  When I'm checking it to know which direction to turn, it's just fine, but when I use the absolute value to try to check vision cones, it doesn't work.  :/  HALP?

How to Use
Xbox controller only, as of right now...
Left stick and right stick comprise movement
Difference in vertical axes causes rotation.
Agreed vertical axis values move the tank forward or backward.
Holding the right trigger fires byullets at a rate of 8 per second.
Watch out for those turretz and tankzzz!nt

Deep Learning
Still on time management this week.  It was a bad week for Assault.  The pitch for GD1 and trying to fit in some indulgent sanity time resulted in a real clustercuss toward the end.  Pulled an all-nighter.  Not fun.  However, I did find that using the process you covered in class really helped to build to spec quickly.  Thanks!  But!  I need to allocate some time every day to work on my projectimundos.
